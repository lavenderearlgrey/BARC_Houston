BARC Houston Animal Shelter Data

This datset includes 12 years of publicly available data on animal intake by zip code at BARC, the city animal shelter in Houston, Texas, USA.

I originally requested this dataset from the city of Houston's public access website for a research project on Toxocoriasis, which has since been published and is available online in <a href="[https://www.w3schools.com/](https://journals.lww.com/pidj/abstract/2023/10000/review_of_toxocariasis_at_a_children_s_hospital.6.aspx)https://journals.lww.com/pidj/abstract/2023/10000/review_of_toxocariasis_at_a_children_s_hospital.6.aspx">The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal</a>. The data was cleaned in part by myself and in part by a colleague. I have included one of the original spreadsheets given to me by the City of Houston as an example of the starting place prior to data cleaning.

Now that we have clean data and a published project, I wanted to use this dataset to practice some data analysis skills and answer some questions I have about stray animals in Houston and the city animal shelter.
